--> Typescript is a language created at microsoft to address the shortcomings of Javscript
--> Javascript is a kid without discipline
--> Typescript is a kid with some discipline
--> For simple projects: Javascript
--> For medium to large projects: Typescipt
-->TS is a superset of JS + some additional features

// Benefits:
--> static typing 
--> code completion
--> refactoring
--> shorthand notations

//Drawbacks
--> Compilation step involved (.ts -> typescript compiler -> .js. This process is called transpilation)
--> Discipline in coding

// There are two types of programming languages:
--> Statically-Typed: C++, C#, Java, Typescript
--> Dynamically-Typed: Javascript, Python, Ruby

--> Dynamically programming languages give a lot of flexibility but can also cause a lot of problems.

eg:
let number = 10;
number = "a";
Math.round(number); // the system can misbehave and can crash

--> Typescipt is essentially Javascript with type checking. In TS we explicitly set the type of the variable

Setting up the Development environment.

Install Node
run: npm i -g typescript
check ts version: tsc -v
To compile TS file: tsc <TS file name>

Configuring the TS compiler: tsc --init

To compile all ts file: tsc
